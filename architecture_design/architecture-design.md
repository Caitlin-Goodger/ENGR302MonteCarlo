# ENGR 301: Architectural Design and Proof-of-Concept

## Proof-of-Concept

The aim of an architectural proof-of-concept (spike or walking skeleton) is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of your chosen architecture, to mitigate technical and project risks, and to plan and validate your technical and team processes (e.g., build systems, story breakdown, Kanban boards, acceptance testing, deployment).

A walking skeleton is an initial technical attempt that will form the architectural foundation of your product. Since a walking skeleton is expected to be carried into your product, it must be completed to the quality standards expected for your final product. A walking skeleton should demonstrate all the technologies your program will rely on "end-to-end" &mdash; from the user interface down to the hardware.

In the context of ENGR 301, a walking skeleton does not need to deliver any business value to your project: the aim is technical validation and risk mitigation.


## Document

The aim of the architectural design document is to describe the architecture and high-level design of the system your group is to build, to identify any critical technical issues with your design, and to explain how you have addressed the highest rated technical and architectural risks. The architecture document should also demonstrate your understanding of architectural techniques and architectural quality, using tools and associated notations as necessary to communicate the architecture precisely, unambiguously and clearly in a written technical document.

Page specifications below are *limits not targets* and refer to the pages in the PDF generated from the markdown. Because the size of your document is necessarily limited, you should ensure that you focus your efforts on those architectural concerns that are most important to completing a successful system: if sections are at their page limit, indicate how many items would be expected in a complete specification.

The ENGR 301 project architecture design document should be based on the standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011(E) _Systems and software engineering &mdash; Architecture description_, plus appropriate sections from ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018(E) _Systems and software engineering &mdash; Life cycle processes &mdash; Requirements engineering_; ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2017 _Systems and software engineering &mdash; Content of life-cycle information items (documentation)_; ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 _Systems and software engineering &mdash; System life-cycle processes_; ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 _Systems and software engineering &mdash; Software life cycle processes_ and ISO 25010 SQuaRE; with notations from ISO/ISE 19501 (UML). In particular, Annex F of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and Annex F of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. These standards are available through the Victoria University Library subscription to the [IEEE Xplore Digital Library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) (e.g., by visiting IEEE Xplore from a computer connected to the University network).

The document should contain the sections listed below, and conform to the formatting rules listed at the end of this brief.

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the document and list their contributions in the last section of the document (please make sure that your continued contribution to this document can be traced in GitLab). You should work on your document in your team's GitLab repository in a directory called "M2_Architecture". If more than one team member has contributed to a particular commit, all those team member IDs should be included in the first line of the git commit message. ``git blame``, ``git diff``, file histories, etc. will be tools used to assess individual contributions, so everyone is encouraged to contribute individually (your contribution should be made to many sections of the document, rather than focusing on just a single section), commit early and commit often.

# ENGR 301 Project 14 Architectural Design and Proof-of-Concept

Caitlin Goodger, Luisa Kristen, Zac Durant, Zak Kiernander, Nicole Stallinger and Matthew Butterfield.

## 1. Introduction

One page overall introduction including sections 1.1 and 1.2 (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011(E) clause 5.2)

Amateur rockets are flown regularly worldwide. These rockets are typically flown with off the shelf rocket motors with widely available propellant reloads. These rockets often exceed the speed of sound, altitudes above 30 km are not unheard of. These rockets are almost never controlled, they are stable due to passive aerodynamic features.

While passively stable rockets are reasonably simple and reliable if well designed, they are susceptible to a variety of disturbances, particularly early in flight. Unexpected winds can cause the rocket to weathercock; flexibility in the launch tower/rail can cause railwhip, imparting a random launch angle to the rocket; the thrust from the rocket motor is also never perfectly symmetrical.

Amateur rockets are often designed in OpenRocket. OpenRocket gives the ability to simulate rockets while altering some parameter variables as a suggestion for the rocketâ€™s performance. After a rocket has been built, it can be measured accurately to give a more accurate simulation to allow for smaller, finalising adjustments including moving the centre of mass. Automation can allow follow this process to be sped up and determine to a higher confidence of the safety of the flight.

The rocket uses a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller to keep it fixed on an axis. Normally, parameters of PID are difficult to obtain due to the short period of time that the rocket motors are burning. Simulation can allow for estimate parameters for the PID controller.

### Client

Andre Geldenhuis is the client for this project. He has experience with rockets and experience working with similar projects. He can be reached in the Customer Channel on Mattermost. He also has occasionally Q&A sessions during ENGR301 Lectures and can be reached during those times with questions. He can also be reached at andre.geldenhuis@vuw.ac.nz.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the system to provide a rocket simulation that can help determine, given certain conditions, the rocket's path and where it will likely land. By having a range of conditions, the system will show a range of paths and possible landing points.

### 1.2 Scope

This product is a Rocket Simulation program. 

*  The program shall provide an automation of simulation program OpenRocket to give a prediction of the flight performance of a rocket. 
*  The program shall provide likely landing locations based on varying parameters such as launch angle and parachute ejection time, through a form of Monte Carlo simulation to determine whether the flight is safe. 
*  The program shall provide estimate PID control parameters through the simulation.


### 1.3 Changes to requirements

If the requirement have changed significantly since the requirements document, outline the changes here. Changes must be justified and supported by evidences, i.e., they must be substantiated. (max one page, only if required)

## 2. References

References to other documents or standards. Follow the IEEE Citation Reference scheme, available from the [IEEE website](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) (PDF; 20 KB). (1 page, longer if required)

## 3. Architecture

Describe your system's architecture according to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011(E), ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.

Note in particular the note to clause 5 of 42010:

_"The verb include when used in Clause 5 indicates that either the information is present in the architecture description or reference to that information is provided therein."_

This means that you should refer to information (e.g. risks, requirements, models) in this or other documents rather than repeat information.

### 3.1 Stakeholders

See ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 clause 5.3 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 clause 6.4.4.3(2).

For most systems this will be about 2 pages, including a table mapping concerns to stakeholder.

#### Stakeholder Requirements

##### Client

##### School of Engineering and Computer Science
* ECS requires that all aspects of the project are correctly licensed. 
* ECS requires all aspects of the project follow the guidelines set out by ECS. 

### 3.2 Architectural Viewpoints
(1 page, 42010 5.4) 

Identify the architectural viewpoints you will use to present your system's architecture. Write one sentence to outline each viewpoint. Show which viewpoint frames which architectural concern.

### 4. Architectural Views

(5 sub-sections of 2 pages each sub-section, per 42010, 5.5, 5.6, with reference to Annex F of both 12207 and 15288) 

Describe your system's architecture in a series of architectural views, each view corresponding to one viewpoint.

You should include views from the following viewpoints (from Kruchten's 4+1 model):

 * Logical
 * Development
 * Process
 * Physical 
 * Scenarios - present scenarios illustrating how two of your most important use cases are supported by your architecture

As appropriate you should include the following viewpoints:

 * Circuit Architecture
 * Hardware Architecture

Each architectural view should include at least one architectural model. If architectural models are shared across views, refer back to the first occurrence of that model in your document, rather than including a separate section for the architectural models.

### 4.1 Logical
...

### 4.2 Development
...

### 4.3 Process
...

### 4.4 Physical 
...

### 4.5 Scenarios
...

## 5. Development Schedule

_For each subsection, make clear what (if anything) has changed from the requirements document._ If unchanged, these sections should be copied over from the requirements document, not simply cross-referenced.

Schedules must be justified and supported by evidences; they must be either direct client requirements or direct consequences of client requirements. If the requirements document did not contain justifications or supporting evidences, then both must be provided here.

### 5.1 Schedule

Identify dates for key project deliverables:

**Architectural prototype**
The architectural prototype will be comeplete by 4 June 2020.

**Minimum viable product**
The minimum viable product as defined in part 1.3.2 of this document will be completed by 4 June 2020.

**Further releases**
Further releases will occur up until the final prototype release, scheduled for the 29 June 2020.

### 5.2 Budget and Procurement

#### 5.2.1 Budget

Present a budget for the project (as a table), showing the amount of expenditure the project requires and the date(s) on which it will be incurred. Substantiate each budget item by reference to fulfilment of project goals (one paragraph per item).

Due to the nature of this project it does not have a budget. The project is extending open source software so there is no need for any licenses to be able to use it. There is also no physical hardware for this project, so no physical items need to be purchased.

#### 5.2.2 Procurement

As stated previously, the nature of the project being purely software means that it does not require hardware items which would need to be procured. The only software required is OpenRocket which is open source and available for access at any point. The storage of the code will be on a group gitlab which is supplied by the university.

### 5.3 Risks 

Identify the ten most important project risks: their type, likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies (3 pages).

### 5.4 Health and Safety

The project does not involve any external work or testing at any other workplaces or sites. This limits H&S concerns to those present in the team members development environment.
Due to COVID-19 reponse no work is taking place in the Victoria University labs and thus all H&S risks such as cable management, occupational strain and workspace ergonomics are the responsibilty of the team member.
Regular breaks will be taken in the prearranged lab slots to ensure members have a chance to stretch and avoid strain. No ethical considerations need to be made around any animal or human subjects due to the nature of the project.

#### 5.4.1 Safety Plans

Project requirements do not involve risk of death, serious harm, harm or injury. The nature of the project as a pure software development exercise limits the saftey concerns involved.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic response safety concerns around the observation of social distancing and quarantine procedure were raised and have been addressed by ensuring all team meetings and work sessions are conducted remotely.

## Formatting Rules 

 * Write your document using [Markdown](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/help/user/markdown#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm) in your team's GitLab repository.
 * Major sections should be separated by a horizontal rule.


## Assessment 

This document will be weighted at 20% on the architectural proof-of-concept(s), and 80% on the architecture design.

The proof-of-concept will be assessed for coverage (does it demonstrate all the technologies needed to build your project?) and quality (with an emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and modifiability).

The document will be assessed by considering both presentation and content. Group and individual group members will be assessed by identical criteria, the group mark for the finished PDF and the individual mark on the contributions visible through `git blame`, `git diff`, file histories, etc. 

The presentation will be based on how easy it is to read, correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, clear diagrams, and so on.

The content will be assessed according to its clarity, consistency, relevance, critical engagement and a demonstrated understanding of the material in the course. We look for evidence these traits are represented and assess the level of performance against these traits. Inspection of the GitLab Group is the essential form of assessing this document. While being comprehensive and easy to understand, this document must be reasonably concise too. You will be affected negatively by writing a report with too many pages (far more than what has been suggested for each section above).
